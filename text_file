    We took some feedbacks from our customers, who picked their repaired vehicle.\
    I want to know the sentiments, emotions and topics the customers are talking.\
    Sentiments of the customer can be 'Positive', 'Negative' or 'Neutral'.\

    Provide me the one word answer of the following questions:
    1 What is the sentiment of the customer feedback? The output can only be one from these 3 words: 'Positive', 'Negative' or 'Neutral'. 
    2 what is the emotion of the following customer feedback? The output should strictly be in one word.
    3 what are the 2 most frequent topics in the customer feedback? The output topics should be comma separated.
    
    The customer feedback is delimited with triple backticks.

    Feedback text: '''{Cust_feedbck}'''
